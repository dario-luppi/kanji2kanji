This repo contains instructions to reproduce the domain transfer results in the paper [Deep Learning for Classical Japanese Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01718).

## Versions

Tested on TensorFlow 1.8.0, scipy 0.19.1, numpy 1.13.3, python 3.5

## Instructions

First run `python build_data.py` to construct the Kanji dataset.

To train models, run `python train.py` to train all models, and run trained models on test set afterwards.

A notebook called `demo.ipynb` is also available to visualize the data and model predictions.
